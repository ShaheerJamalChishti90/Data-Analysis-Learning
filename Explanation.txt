01: Im doing a business by running a coffee shop:

=> Im the owner of a shop I just sell the coffee
=> The thing is that I dont produce the coffee, I just sell it
=> I actually buy coffee(beans) from somewhere else and then sell it on my shop
=> Im buying coffee from somewhere, I must be paying him for coffees
=> Im buying coffee from him on a certain price and then selling the coffee at my shop on some other different price
=> for eg: I buy latte from him for 5$, and selling it on my shop at 10$
=> 5$ is the original price(The price I bought the coffee for)
=> 10$ is the price Im selling coffee at(its my price so that i can earn some money from my business)


IS EVERYTHING CRYSTAL CLEAR NOW???
